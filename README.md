## ü•£ Overview

This repository contains a FastAPI-based web API that helps determine if a URL is bad (potentially phishing) or good (not malicious). The API uses a Machine Learning model trained on a dataset of over 4,000 URLs, categorizing them as "bad" or "good".

The model is based on a Logistic Regression classifier using the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) vectorizer for text representation. It has been pre-trained on the provided dataset of URLs and can quickly classify new URLs.

## üí† Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/phishing-url-detection.git
cd phishing-url-detection
```

2. Install the required dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ‚ú® Usage

1. Prepare your dataset:
   - Ensure you have a CSV file named `data/main.csv` containing the list of URLs to be categorized.
   - The CSV file should have two columns: `URL` (containing the URLs) and `Label` (with values "bad" or "good" indicating the classification).

2. Start the FastAPI server:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload --workers 2
```

3. Access the API:
   - Open your web browser or a tool like Postman.
   - Go to `http://localhost:8000` to view the API introduction and server information.

4. Check URLs for Phishing:

   To check if a specific URL is bad or good, use the `/checkurl` endpoint with the `url` parameter:

   - **Request:**

     ```
     GET http://localhost:8000/checkurl?url=https://example.com
     ```

   - **Response:**

     ```
     {
         "url": "https://example.com",
         "type": "good" || "bad"
     }
     ```

   The `type` field can have values "good" or "bad," indicating the classification result.
